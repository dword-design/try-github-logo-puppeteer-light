Minimal example of GitPod manipulating an external image.

`file.png` contains the file downloaded from https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/cropped-github-favicon-512.png?fit=32%2C32 locally.

Run `yarn start` to download the file from inside GitPod via `wget`.

Now you have git changes although it should be the same file.
